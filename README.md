# Introduction

In order to get started and completely understand the mechanism behind the oasis-direct-proxy, one should first familiarize themselves with the DSProxy contract.

**DS Proxy Summary**

The DS Proxy contract works by executing transactions and sequences of transactions by proxy. The proxy works as a deployed standalone smart contract, which can then be used by the owner to execute code.

In short, the contract works by having a user pass in bytecode for the contract as well as the `calldata` for the function they want to execute. The proxy will then create a contract using the bytecode and then use the `delegatecall` function with arguments specified in the `calldata`. The reason for this process is because loading in the code is more efficient than jumping to it.

If you would like to read and understand how the DS Proxy contract works further, please visit the contract [here](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-proxy/blob/master/src/proxy.sol).

## Oasis Direct Proxy

When learning about how the Oasis Direct Proxy works, it is important to understand some of the main naming conventions that are used in the contracts. Below is a brief summary to help you better understand the main terminology, variables and methods used within the Oasis Direct Proxy:

**Methods**:

- `sellAllAmount`
- `sellAllAmountPayEth`
- `sellAllAmountBuyEth`
- `buyAllAmount`
- `buyAllAmountPayEth`
- `buyAllAmountBuyEth`

The main methods are the `sellAllAmount*` and `buyAllAmount*` and the other methods listed above have the same intention plus extended functionality.

**Note**: There are cases where the `received` amount could be more or less. For example, a token could have been sold for a higher or lower price.

**Other**:

`payable` : A modifier that enables a contract to collect / receive funds in *`ETH`*

#### How to sell tokens:

When a trade occurs, there is always a token that is sold and one that is bought. Using OasisDirectProxy one can sell tokens using both sellAll* and buyAll* methods. There is a significant difference regarding the amounts that will be sold/bought when different methods are used. In the examples below, we will try to highlight the differences and explain in detail when one should use each of the methods.

All of the scenarios will include the following prerequisites:
 -- One would like to exchange (sell) `MKR` for (buy) `DAI`.
 -- The price is `15 MKR/DAI`

 - ***Case Scenario 1:*** -    In this scenario, the market price will not fluctuate but will be stable, therefore no [slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) will occur in the price. Additionally, the caller would like to sell `10 MKR`. At the given price of `MKR`, this means that the caller will receive `150 DAI`. Due to the fact that the price is stable and won't fluctuate before the trade is completed, the caller might use both the `sellAllAmount` or `buyAllAmount` and because of this they will sell exactly `10 MKR` and will receive exactly `150 DAI` in return. 
 - ***Case Scenario 2*** -   This scenario highlights when [slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) occurs and when the price decreases. In the case when the price is not stable it gets a little more complicated. This is because from the moment when a trade transaction is initiated until when it is confirmed, many things can happen. For example, if the caller wants to sell `10 MKR` and the price falls to `10 MKR/DAI`, the caller will receive only `100 DAI`. Again, the caller might use either `sellAllAmount` or `buyAllAmount`. The following scenarios capture this:
	 - ***Case Scenario 2.1*** - This scenario captures the situation when the caller is aware of the price and their goal is to sell `10 MKR` and get as much DAI as possible. This is when they might use the `sellAllAmount` method. As shown above, the price might decrease significantly. In order to protect the caller from losing a large amount of their funds, we introduced the `minBuyAmt` parameter. For example, let’s say that there is a scenario where we will use `140 DAI` as `minBuyAmt`. This means that the caller would like to receive at least `140 DAI` in the trade. In the situation where slippage occurs, this may cause the price to drop below `14 MKR/DAI` which in turn causes the transaction to fail and revert.
	 - ***Case Scenario 2.2*** - This scenario captures the situation when the caller is aware of the price and would like to sell MKR and get `150 DAI`. In this case, one can use `buyAllAmount` method. Again, the price might decrease and the caller might pay more than `10 MKR` in order to get their desired `150 DAI`. In order to protect the caller from spending too much, we introduced the `maxPayAmt` parameter. For example, let’s say that we will use `11 MKR` to trade. This means that the caller would like to deposit a maximum of `11 MKR`. In the situation where slippage occurs, the price drops below `~13.63 MKR/DAI` and therefor transaction will fail and revert.

 - ***Case Scenario 3:*** -  This scenario highlights a situation when a positive [slippage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/slippage.asp) occurs and the price increases. For example, let’s say the price moves from `15 MKR/DAI` to `20 MKR/DAI`. Again, the caller might use both `sellAllAmount` and `buyAllAmount`. The caller has to decide between two options based on their current priority: 

    1. Sell all of their tokens and get as much as possible. 
    2. Receive some fixed amount of the quote and pay as little as possible.

   - ***Case Scenario 3.1:*** -  This scenario captures the situation where a caller is interested in selling `10 MKR`. By calling `sellAllAmount`, they will sell all of the `10 MKR` at the price of `20 MKR/DAI` and will receive `200 DAI`.
   - ***Case Scenario 3.2:*** - This scenario captures the situation where the caller is interested in buying `150 DAI`. By calling `buyAllAmount` the caller will sell only `7.5 MKR` at the price of `20 MKR/DAI` in order to receive the desired amount in `DAI`.

`Threshold`: It is a collective term to refer to the `maxSellAmount` and `minBuyAmount` paramters. Why and when to use them once can refer to the case scenarios described above.

## OTC Interface Contract

This contract provides an interface that exposes the following three methods:

- `sellAllAmount`
- `buyAllAmount`
- `getPayAmount`

All from the [Maker OTC Market](https://github.com/makerdao/maker-otc/blob/master/src/matching_market.sol).

## Token Interface Contract

This contract is an interface which contains `ERC-20 token` methods as well as methods from the [WETH token](https://github.com/dapphub/ds-weth/blob/master/src/weth9.sol) contract, such as `deposit` and `withdraw`.

# [OasisDirectProxy Contract](https://github.com/makerdao/oasis-direct-proxy/blob/gg/readme/src/OasisDirectProxy.sol)

**Summary:** This contract can be used by anyone who wishes to swap tokens directly on [eth2dai](https://www.notion.so/makerdao/%5B%3Chttps://eth2dai.com%3E%5D(%3Chttps://eth2dai.com/%3E)).

## Key functionalities (as defined in the Smart Contract)

### withdrawAndSend

**Summary:** `withdrawAndSend` is used internally as the modifier states. This function is used in the following other methods:

- `sellAllAmountBuyEth`
- `buyAllAmountPayEth`
- `buyAllAmountBuyEth`

The purpose of this function is to withdraw the locked up `ETH` from the `WETH token` contract and then send it to the caller.

**Parameters:**

- `TokenInterface wethToken` - The address of the `WETH token` contract.
- `uint wethAmt` - The amount which will be withdrawn and sent.

**Modifiers**

- `internal` - When you see this modifier, it means that the function and/or state variable can only be accessed internally (i.e. from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it).

---

### sellAllAmount

**Summary:** `sellAllAmount` is used when triggering an ERC-20 for ERC-20 exchange, where the `payAmt` is sent to this contract from the caller. After that, the `otc` contract is guaranteed to have enough allowance in the `payToken` to do transfers on behalf of `this` contract. The next step is to proceed and sell the `payToken`. Lastly, the transfer occurs for the `buyAmt` to the caller.

**Parameters:**

- [OtcInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/maker-otc-support-methods/blob/master/src/MakerOtcSupportMethods.sol#L5) `otc` - This represents the contract address of the OTC market contract (where only a few methods are exposed).
- [TokenInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/oasis-direct-proxy/blob/master/src/OasisDirectProxy.sol#L11) `payToken` - An address of any `ERC-20 token` or token that implements the interface of it.
- `uint payAmt` - The amount that is to be sold.
- [TokenInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/oasis-direct-proxy/blob/master/src/OasisDirectProxy.sol#L11) `buyToken` - The contract address of any `ERC-20 token`.
- `uint minBuyAmt` - Reference **threshold**.

**Returns:**

- `uint buyAmt` - The amount of `buyToken` that will be purchased.

**Errors:**

- `payToken.transferFrom` - This might cause the transaction to fail if the caller has not authorized `this` contract to do transfers.
- `otc.sellAllAmount` - This might cause the transaction to fail if the `buyAmt` results in being less than `minBuyAmt`.
- `buyToken.transfer` - This might cause the transaction to fail.

---

### sellAllAmountPayEth

**Summary:** The `sellAllAmountPayEth` method is  used when triggering an`ETH` for `ERC-20 token`exchange. The process begins when `ETH` is sent, it is then wrapped into `WETH token` and once the `otc` is guaranteed to have enough allowance, the locked `WETH` is then sold on the `otc` using `minBuyAmt` as a safeguard against slippage. Lastly, the `buyAmt` is sent back to the caller.

**Parameters:**

- [OtcInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/maker-otc-support-methods/blob/master/src/MakerOtcSupportMethods.sol#L5) `otc` - An address of the contract that represents the OTC market contract.

- `uint minBuyAmt` - Reference **threshold**.

**Modifiers**

- `payable` - Added to the method to enable the receipt of Eth.

**Returns:**

- `uint buyAmt` - The amount of `buyToken` that will be purchased.

**Errors:**

- `buyToken.transfer` - This might cause the transaction to fail.

---

### sellAllAmountBuyEth

**Summary:** The `sellAllAmountBuyEth`  is used when triggering an `ERC-20 token` for `ETH` exchange method has the same functionality as mentioned in `sellAllAmount` but with a difference, which is the withdrawal of the purchased `wethAmt` from the `WETH token` contract and then sending it to the caller in the form of native `ETH`.

**Parameters:**

- [OtcInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/maker-otc-support-methods/blob/master/src/MakerOtcSupportMethods.sol#L5) `otc` - An address of the contract that represents the OTC market contract.
- [TokenInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/oasis-direct-proxy/blob/master/src/OasisDirectProxy.sol#L11) `payToken` - An address of any `ERC-20 token` or token that implements the interface.

- `otc.sellAllAmount` - This might cause the transaction to fail if the `buyAmt` results are less than `minBuyAmt`.
- `withdrawAndSend` - This might cause the transaction to fail.

---

### buyAllAmount

**Summary:**  `buyAllAmount`  is used when triggering an `ERC-20 token` for `ERC-20 token` exchange. It calculates the amount to be paid, then the `payAmt` is transferred to this contract. Next, the `otc` contract is guaranteed to have enough allowance in the `payToken` to perform transfers on behalf of `this` contract. Follows a buy operation, where `buyAmt` is bought. Lastly, the transfer of the purchased amount to the caller occurs.

**Parameters:**

- [OtcInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/maker-otc-support-methods/blob/master/src/MakerOtcSupportMethods.sol#L5) `otc` - An address of the contract that represents the OTC market contract.
- [TokenInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/oasis-direct-proxy/blob/master/src/OasisDirectProxy.sol#L11) `buyToken` - An address of any `ERC-20 token` or token that implements the interface.

- `uint maxPayAmt` - Reference **threshold**.

**Returns:**

- `uint payAmt` - The amount of `payToken` that will be paid out.

**Errors:**

- `otc.getPayAmount` - This might cause the transaction to fail if there isn't enough of an order to fill the `buyAmt`
    - This might also cause the transaction to fail if the calculated amount that is to be paid is higher than `maxPayAmt`
- `payToken.transferFrom` - This might cause the transaction to fail.
- `otc.buyAllAmount` - This might cause the transaction to fail if it needs to pay more than the calculated amount that needs to be paid in the beginning of the transaction.
- `buyToken.transfer` - This might cause the transaction to fail.

---

### buyAllAmountPayEth

**Summary:** The `buyAllAmountPayEth`  is used when triggering an `ETH` for `ERC-20 token` exchange. When called, the `ETH` sent in is locked in `WETH token`. Then, once the `otc` contract is guaranteed to have enough allowance in the `wethToken` to do transfers on the behalf of `this` contract, the buy operation proceeds to calculate the `wethAmt`. Next, the purchased amount is transferred to the caller. Lastly, the difference between the amount of `ETH` sent to the contract method and the actual amount needed to buy the `buyToken` amount is sent.

**Disclaimer:** It is important to note that there is neither `minBuyAmt` nor `maxPayAmt` here. It works by having the caller of the method take into account the slippage that might occur and thus send more `ETH` (the max amount he is willing to pay in order to get the `buyAmt`). If less amount of ETH is spent to get the buyAmt, the remaining amount of the sent ETH is returned to the caller.

**Parameters:**

- [OtcInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/maker-otc-support-methods/blob/master/src/MakerOtcSupportMethods.sol#L5) `otc` - An address of the contract that represents the OTC market contract.
- [TokenInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/oasis-direct-proxy/blob/master/src/OasisDirectProxy.sol#L11) `buyToken` - An address of any `ERC-20 token` or token that implements the interface.
- `uint buyAmt` - The amount that will be purchased.
- [TokenInterface](https://github.com/makerdao/oasis-direct-proxy/blob/master/src/OasisDirectProxy.sol#L11) `wethToken` - The address of the `WETH token`

**Modifiers**

- `payable`- Added to enable the receipt of Eth.

**Returns:**

- `uint wethAmt` - The amount of `WETH token` that will be paid.

**Errors**

- `otc.buyAllAmount` - This might cause the transaction to fail if the the caller is expected to pay more `ETH` than has been sent.
- `buyToken.transfer` - This might cause the transaction to fail.
- `withdrawAndSend` - This might cause the transaction to fail.

---
